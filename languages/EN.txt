{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Well, they're puzzles where all the pieces
are white like milk, hence the name.
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

Since there's no picture on them,
they're much harder than regular puzzles.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Very smart people can finish them
in no time at all, but...
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

To be honest, they're not exciting.
Since they don't even make a picture in the end...
##

{Garry} (13)

It feels much more worth it
to do a puzzle of a picture you like.

Heheh... Did you know, Ib? The first time
your father saw a Guertena painting in a book...
##

{Ib's Mother} (01)
#Message#

He had a nightmare that night!
It must have had quite an impact on him.
##

{Ib's Mother} (04)
#Message#

Oh? Are you scared too, Ib? Oh well...
We can sleep together tonight.
##

{Ib's Mother} (04)
#Message#

Guertena's works are often eerie,
but they somehow captivate me...
##

{Ib's Mother} (01)
#Message#

I never get tired of them!
Yes, I adore Guertena!
##

{Ib's Mother} (00)
#Message#

Do you have a favorite piece, Ib?
##

#Message#

I personally quite liked that white sofa.
I'd like to have it at home!
##

{Ib's Mother} (01)
#Message#

Haha, but I'm sure your father would object...
##

{Ib's Mother} (00)
#Message#

I've heard there are many more
Guertena pieces out there...
##

{Ib's Mother} (04)
#Message#

Sigh... If only I could,
I would love to see them all for myself...
##

{Ib's Mother} (07)
#Message#

While we're at the Guertena exhibition,
I'd like to get a souvenir.
##

{Ib's Mother} (00)
#Message#

Do they have any replicas of the paintings?
That wall in our entryway does look a little bare...
##

{Ib's Mother} (01)
#Message#

I hope the three of us can go together again
the next time they hold a Guertena exhibition,
##

{Ib's Mother} (00)
#Message#

I imagine you'd make a lot of new discoveries
revisiting this art when you're older, Ib.

{Ib's Father} (01)
#Message#

Oh... Ib. How's the Guertena exhibition?
##

{Ib's Father} (04)
#Message#

So many paintings,
it's almost an ordeal to look at them all...
##

{Ib's Father} (03)
#Message#

But it's nice to take your time
and just appreciate art like this sometimes.
##

{Ib's Father} (01)
#Message#

How're you liking your first art gallery, Ib?
##

{Ib's Father} (03)
#Message#

They have a peculiar mood to them,
but I think it's pretty nice.
##

{Ib's Father} (01)
#Message#

If you like this one,
maybe we can go to another exhibition sometime.
##

{Ib's Father} (02)
#Message#

I have to say, "Abyss of the Deep"
is probably the most impressive of the lot.
##

{Ib's Father} (01)
#Message#

If I stare at it too long, it starts to feel like
I'm really going to fall into the painting!
##

{Ib's Father} (00)
#Message#

Your father may not know a lot about art, but...
##

{Ib's Father} (01)
#Message#

I think I can say for sure that
Guertena was one amazing guy!
##

{Ib's Father} (02)
#Message#

There's a painting named "Worry" over there...
##

{Ib's Father} (06)
#Message#

It's kinda creepy the way
it feels like it's watching me.
##

{Ib's Father} (01)
#Message#

What do you suppose
your mother likes about Guertena?
##

{Ib's Father} (00)
#Message#

Sure, he's pretty amazing,
but a lot of his work is so creepy...
##

{Ib's Father} (00)
#Message#

Is there something captivating about that...?
##

{Ib's Father} (06)
#Message#

I-Ib... I heard someone coughing
when there was no one around...
##

{Ib's Father} (05)
#Message#

Your father's getting a little scared...
...I'm sure it was just my imagination, though.
##

{Ib's Father} (01)
#Message#

Your mother's been in unusually high spirits here...
##

{Ib's Father} (03)

When I see her happy, it makes me kinda happy too.

I'm sure you still remember them now...
##

{Garry} (16)
#Message#

So you shouldn't need me
to understand these titles.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

You know, about Guertena's works...
They've given us some dreadful memories.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Yet there were some who helped us out, weren't there?
##

{Garry} (11)
#Message#

I guess when you think of it that way, things aren't
so different between humans and living art.
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

Say, about Mary...
I wonder what she was after, in the end.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

She seemed different from the other more violent works,
and talked to us like an ordinary person.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

When we first met,
I do recall she said she "wanted to get out"...
##

{Garry} (17)
#Message#

Perhaps she really was
trying to get out of that world...?
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

Don't you feel a lot of artists are oddballs,
that you can never really tell what they're thinking?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I guess they must see the world
quite differently from the average person...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

How do you usually spend your time, Ib?
Playing with your friends?
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

You should play plenty while you're still young.
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

Guertena really made so much art...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I wonder if he got tired of creating art all the time?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Ib, about the handkerchief I borrowed...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

If I can't get the stains out of it,
I'll gladly buy you a new one.
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

......Huh? You got it from your mother?
As a birthday present?!
##

{Garry} (19)
#Message#

...I-I'll get it clean, no matter what it takes!!
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

*sigh*... I wonder if I'll be able to sleep at night.
##

{Garry} (05)

It's all too easy to imagine myself tossing and turning
while I think back on what happened today...

**********Common37********** (相談　灰の間)
{Garry} (18)
#Message#

I wonder if that thing in front of the door
would move out of the way?
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

So there are talking artworks like that, too.
I don't suppose it'd tell us where the exit is...
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

That was one nasty surprise!
What is with that army of eyeballs?!
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

Say, didn't that eyeball
look a bit redder than the others...?
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

I wonder if it got sand in itself...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Grieving?
But they're dressed in such celebratory clothes...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

I get it now... The ring was missing,
hence the "Grieving" titles.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Interesting how the title of a work
can change like this, though...
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

"Bride's Hand"... It looks a bit scary, doesn't?
Writhing like that...
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

That's right, wedding rings go on the
left ring finger! How could I forget?
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

I suppose it's natural, but... so many paintings.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

If every last one of these was made by Guertena,
I wonder just how much he painted in his lifetime...
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

I wish things wouldn't suddenly fall like that...
It's bad for my poor heart.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

That strange thing is gone now,
so let's take a look inside the room.
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

I feel you wouldn't normally
place a painting so low on a wall...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

What do you suppose this red ball is for?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

So this ring was for the Bride's Hand.
That explains why it was a bit large...
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

This place is just full of things to pick up
without having a clue what they're for...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

What a beautiful bouquet.
When I look at flowers, I feel at peace.
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

Speaking of which...
Wasn't there someone longing for flowers?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

If we used these eyedrops, do you suppose
it might let us see the invisible, perhaps?
##

#Choice#
I think so!
Like ghosts?
##

<なるほど！>

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

Wait, hold on, I was joking!
We don't know what's in there...
##

<オバケとか？>

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

R-Right, yes! Ahaha...
\}I won't dare use them in that case...
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

So there was no exit here after all...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Well, perhaps we should just be thankful
for the absence of painted ladies chasing us.
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

The bride and groom paintings changed...
Does that mean we did the right thing?
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

On the back of the white bust's head...
What does that mean?
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

In the skull's left hand...
Was there a skull somewhere?
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

Inside the big tree...
What do you mean, inside a tree?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I'm curious about the message that was on
the back of that painting... Shall we look around?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Let's check that painting that fell!
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

A hidden passage... Who'd have thought?
We might not have found it without being told.
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

Why are these eyeballs in a place where
it's so easy for things to get in them, anyhow?
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

Where else have we not checked?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I hope what we did has actually
done something to help us...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

First off... shall take a look around?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

What an outrageous amount of easels...!
They all seem to have the same painting on them.
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

......Th-That startled me...
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

So the subject of the paintings was
a bottle of eyedrops. Not sure why you'd paint that...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

I wonder if it was lured to come take a look here
by the smell of tea...?
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

I like the smell of tea, but it's a bit strong here.
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

I get it... You're clever!
It looks like you got it right.
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

But I wonder if there was
some meaning to all this...?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

The teacups seem pushable.
Shall we try moving them around?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

It's like we're on top of a table here...
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

Such large teapots and cups...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

It seems Guertena made
many works of art besides just paintings.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

He was surely multi-talented...
I'm a bit envious. Just a little bit.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

That's rather large for a ring, isn't it?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Is this a display room for sculptures?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

None of these works were present at the Guertena
exhibition... These could be valuable, in a sense.
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

Urk, it's a tight squeeze...
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

Whoa, what in the world...?
Let's make our way through quickly...
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

There's no shortage of creepy artwork here,
but these painted ladies are the scariest to me...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Noble Boasting of Gold...
Is that bird perched on his hand made of gold, too?
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

Even if it's small, gold is gold, you know...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

We gave up a lamp, but I suppose it's fine, hm?
The light from it was too weak to be much help.
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

A trade, hmm...
Do you think we should go ahead with it?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

What should we do with that noble?
He seems to really want that golden elephant...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

He seems fond of it, at any rate...
I suppose that's fine, then.
##

{Garry} (17)
#Message#

Why are there so many of those painted ladies here...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Step...
It's not going to suddenly start walking, right?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

What have we here? An elephant?
It's got a lamp hanging from its trunk.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

But I feel it's not doing its job
as a light source very well...
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

Truthfully, I wanted to take the fish lamp with us...
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

Maybe I'm being too cautious,
but I was sure she would jump out and attack...
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

I'm sure that'll make it easier to read the paper,
but I wonder if it's too bright now?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I can't imagine reading a newspaper
in a place this dark...
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

I was worried how heavy this would be if it were
real gold, but it seems it's not... It's light.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I'd like to trade it to her, but we might need this...
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

It just occurred to me... I feel as if I've seen
that Lady Reading the Newspaper somewhere before.
##

{Garry} (19)
#Message#

Hey, now! Don't be so rash when
you don't even know what the deal is...
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

Ib, I'm afraid I can't support you
offering your rose so frivolously...
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

This all just seems very suspicious.
I think you were right to refuse.
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

You saw that painting chow down
a whole bouquet earlier, remember?
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

If you gave away your rose,
that could well happen to it... Understand?
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

Why do so many of them want flowers...?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Could we search around that door some more?
I feel like it might open rather simply!
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

If even me hanging onto it didn't work,
do we need something heavier than me...?
##

#Choice#
Let's search!
Should I hang with you?
It might need something else
##

<さがそう！>

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

Huh, really?! Could there be something like that...?
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

Besides... could you even carry it?
##

<自分も一緒にぶらさがる？>

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Hmm, no... I just get the feeling that
any number of people couldn't pull it down.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Let's search this large room a bit more.
Who knows, there could be a switch to open it.
##

<別の何かがいるのかも>

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

True... Odd things like rings and eyedrops
have helped us proceed before, after all.
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

Then perhaps the cage itself is a hint?
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

Let's look for something else to put inside!
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

Let's take a look inside that room!
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Say, can't we explore that room some more?
There was something in the back!
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

I can't help but think the key to moving these bars
is the cage next to it...
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

Thinking about it, I suppose it is
commonplace for paintings to move here...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

You know, looking at that Hanged Man again...
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

He's wearing some unusual clothes, hm?
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

This bird is very pretty...
I suppose I can understand wanting to show it off.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

If paintings can move, it seems likely that
sculptures can too, don't you think?
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

I wonder why this elephant doesn't?
We could have ridden on its back...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

This lamp is nice and bright...
I think we can see our surroundings better now.
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

That writing on the mirror...
"A fragment of the fish is by the yellow lady," was it?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

The fish likely means that object we picked up...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

So "a fragment"...
Could there still be other parts to it?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

This golden fish reminds me of that
large fish painting from the Guertena exhibit...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I wonder if this ball is also a key
to solving the puzzles here...
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

It seems the numbers were correct!
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Once we learn the four numbers, we should \C[1]input them
on the floor and knock on the door\C[0]... apparently.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Let's take a look around for anything unusual.
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

Ugh, that took me by surprise.
Let's leave here at once!
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

......Let's leave quickly.
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

I nearly got distracted by the mirror
and tripped on that! Careful, careful...
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

I must say, this lamp is impressive.
I wonder how it functions...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

There's nothing more in this room, surely?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

About the only thing we haven't checked here
is that mirror, right?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Over on the wall... Is that a mirror?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

There's a vase here... This room seems safe.
Thank goodness...
##

{Garry} (17)
#Message#

Ib... Let's leave quickly.
It'd be dangerous if that mannequin fell.
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

..................
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Ib... Cheer up, okay?
I'm sure your mom and dad are somewhere.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I think I saw this sofa at the Guertena exhibition.
I forget its name, though...
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

Hmm... I'm not seeing an exit, unfortunately...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Ib, what's wrong?
Did you forget something?
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

Hmm...
I don't think we need to go back this way.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

We've found some new stairs,
so let's go downstairs from there!
##

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

There's no water in this vase...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Ah, yes...
We went through here by ourselves earlier.
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Were you hoping to use a vase?
Does... your rose not have many petals?
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

Nah, I'm okay... Let's get going!
##

{Mary} (05)
#Message#

Let's hold hands, Ib!
##

{Garry} (12)
#Message#

I have to say, I'm glad this room was so close by...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Doors seem to keep painted ladies from coming in,
and that painting there seems harmless.
##


**********Common38********** (相談　紫の間以降)
{Garry} (06)
#Message#

I'm curious about those red marks on the floor...
What do you say we follow those?
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

I pick circles!
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

What's that, now...?
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Because there's circles, triangles,
and squares here, right?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Ahh... right.
These unusual sculptures.
##

{Mary} (05)
#Message#

I think Ib's a square,
and Garry is... a triangle!
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

(It seems this girl's a real oddball...)
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

It's like a maze...
It seems we can't get over these pointy rocks.
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

What is that red stuff...? Crayon?!
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

After that mannequin incident earlier,
I don't much want to look into more mirrors...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Mirrors are strange, aren't they? It's like there's
really a copy of the world on the other side.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

...Ib, are you all right?
You've looked restless since we found that mirror...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

If you're tired, we can take another rest, all right?
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

That was surprising, huh?
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

Indeed... I hope for as few such sounds as possible,
for my heart's sake...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

I think we can move that statue out of the way
if we get around to the other side of it!
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

And now, we can make a full loop!
##

{Garry} (13)
#Message#

This sort of maze is a bit simple for us now,
wouldn't you say?
##

#Choice#
Yeah!
It was kinda hard...
##

<うん！>

{Garry} (08)
#Message#

Indeed, we've solved all sorts of puzzles, after all!
##

<結構難しかった……>

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

Ah, sorry. Look at me, getting all cocky
just because I got through a maze...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

So far, the puzzles here seem to be
solvable entirely within the same-colored area.
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

Perhaps if this place were all one color, we would've
been running all over the place looking for hints...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

We've been all over this area, haven't we?
Let's move forward.
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

Something's written on the floor...
but I find myself wanting not to read it.
##

{Garry} (19)
#Message#

Let's leave, quickly.
##

{Garry} (17)
#Message#

I don't like this room. Let's leave...
##

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

Are you a scaredy-cat, Garry?
##

{Garry} (19)
#Message#

I'm not a scaredy-cat,
it's the room to blame for being scary!
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Is there only one painting in here?
It's an oddly spacious room...
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Ib, let's hurry up and go!
##

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

How do we use this key?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I mean, normally doors have keyholes,
so you'd just use that...
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

But here, you insert the whole key
into doors to open them... It's bizarre.
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

It's fun walking all together!
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Mary, you were alone until now...
Were you attacked by any artwork?
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

Nope? I was fine!
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Ah... So you were lucky.
Some of the things here will chase after you.
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

If you encounter one, run away immediately!
##

{Mary} (05)
#Message#

Got it! I love running!
##

{Garry} (08)
#Message#

Haha... Then you'll be fine.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Now that there's three of us, we may be able
to go places we couldn't go before.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Say, Mary...
You came from this way, didn't you?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Were there any other routes?
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

Routes? I dunno...
I walked a bunch, so I'm not sure.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Ah... Well, for all we know, a path could appear
where there was once a wall, like earlier.
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

(Though honestly, if it were a straight path,
 that wouldn't bode well...)
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

A purple key!
Will this open the door?
##

{Garry} (13)
#Message#

Good! We can say goodbye to this room at once!
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

Garry cheered up pretty quickly, didn't he?
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

Let's quickly check everything we can here,
then go to the room on the opposite side.
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Wooow...!
##

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

I wonder if Garry's waiting for us?
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

How'd it move without any legs, you think?
##

{Mary} (04)
#Message#

I don't like the dark!
It's scary not being able to see...
##

{Mary} (05)
#Message#

A whole lot of boxes!
Bet there's something good here!
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

When there's something sticking out of a painting,
I just wanna grab it!
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

Ib, do you know the circus?
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

It's a place where they throw around lots of balls,
and go inside lion's mouths and stuff!
##

{Mary} (04)
#Message#

I'm bored of this place... Let's move on!
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

The blue thingy fell...
I wonder if it broke?
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Hey, so what's that bright blue thing?
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

Hey, let's cross already!
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

The green painting came down!
##

{Mary} (06)
#Message#

Hmm... How do we get across?
It's too far to jump, even...
##

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

That painting's got eyes on it!
What's it looking at?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Wow... Is this a display as well?
##

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

...That was just a what-if, okay?
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

This is the way we came! Are you going back?
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Wooow...! What's this place?!
##

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

Can we go back upstairs?
There's only one place we haven't gone!
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Is there? Then let's make our way.
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

The floor's weird!
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Was this place... always like this?
I feel as if it was more suffocating...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I've been here, too... I think.
I believe I was searching for something.
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

Ib, let's check where that voice is coming from!
##

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

......?
Hey, did you hear something?
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

Huh? The walls here are the same purple
as back when we were with Garry...
##

{Mary} (03)
#Message#

...We found Garry, but...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I examined nearly all of this floor,
so I don't think there's anything left here...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

After we split up, I found a secret passage...
So I went through it, and it led me here.
##

{Garry} (08)
#Message#

I was deeply worried what I'd do if we could
never meet up again, but I'm glad we did.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

There was some sort of gas in this room earlier...
but it seems to have stopped.
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

...I found a book on Guertena's works here.
And in it was... Mary...
##

{Garry} (07)
#Message#

I swear I saw it. A page for "Mary,"
said to be the last work Guertena made...
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

Painted with yellow roses,
looking just the way we saw her...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

So you went all this way with Mary, Ib?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Huh? Oh, no, I'm not angry at all!
It allowed us to meet back up, even.
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

Though the thing with Mary was, well... unfortunate...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Still, so as not to waste all our efforts...
let's not give up now!
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

So then... where should we be going?
Over this way, right?
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

Hey, Ib.
Let's unlock that door quickly!
##

{Mary} (05)
#Message#

Isn't it exciting to go somewhere
you've never been before?
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

What rooms haven't we seen yet, again?
##

{Mary} (03)
#Message#

This painting is so big, it's hard to carry it around!
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

Umbrellas are so neat...
You can fly by holding these, right?
##

#Choice#
Um...?
That's right
##

<えっ……？>

{Mary} (09)
#Message#

H... Huh? You... can't fly?
Like, the wind whooshes in, and..........
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Ah... umm, maybe it was just a story I read!
A story where she flies with an umbrella!
##

{Mary} (05)
#Message#

Ahaha, just a little whoopsie...
##

<そうだよ>

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

So cool... I wanna try flying, too!
##

{Mary} (03)
#Message#

But you shouldn't do it inside, huh...
I'll definitely fly when we get outside!
##

{Mary} (03)
#Message#

You think this umbrella can destroy the spikies?
Maybe if we whack them a bunch with it!
##

{Mary} (04)
#Message#

That'll break it?
Yeah, I guess... Maybe not, then.
##

{Mary} (05)
#Message#

Whew... I'm tired from all the stuff we did.
What to do now...?
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Ib! There's an umbrella!
I think it's okay for you to take it!
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

The snake's belly flattened out...
I wonder where the thing inside went?
##

{Mary} (06)
#Message#

I'm tired of swapping these snake paintings...
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

Just tell me if you wanna
swap those snake paintings again!
##

{Mary} (05)
#Message#

I'll handle it for you!
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Finally, a new room we can go to!
Let's go!
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

Ib, do you like looking at pictures
or drawing them more?
##

#Choice#
Looking
Drawing
Neither
##

<観るの>

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

Hmm... Doodling's fun, though!
You can draw lots of anything you like!
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Oh, but yeah,
I guess I like looking at Dad's art too!
##

<描くの>

{Mary} (05)
#Message#

Oh yeah? I wanna see your art, Ib!
I wonder which of us is better at drawing?!
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

Be sure to show me later!
##

<どっちも好きじゃない>

{Mary} (09)
#Message#

Whaaa, really?
Then why'd you come to an art gallery?
##

{Mary} (01)
#Message#

Lots of paintings! Let's take a look!
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

There's an archive here as well...
Perhaps all these books belong to Guertena.
##

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

Kinda cramped... It's a room of books!
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

We've crossed the rainbow bridge...
but I did get a bit weak in the knees...
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

What the... a rainbow bridge?!
Is it safe to cross?
##

{Mary} (09)
#Message#

It's a rainbow, Ib! A rainbow bridge!
##

{Mary} (00)
#Message#

This place is weird...
How do we color it in?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Why is it raining in this room?
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

I wonder if that painting we can't reach
will move down for us, like the green one earlier?
##

{Mary} (04)
#Message#

Come on, give her back her umbrella...
Don't you feel bad?
##

{Mary} (02)
#Message#

Wow!
Where's this water coming from?!
##

{Mary} (05)
#Message#

There's stuff here too!
Ehehe, so much to do...!
##

{Garry} (13)
#Message#

Is our next step past that blocked path?
All right, leave it to me!
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

Now, let's resume our search for the exit!
##

{Mary} (03)
#Message#

Why's it blocking the way...?
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Stairs!
Can we finally go someplace new?!
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

............
##

{Mary} (08)
#Message#

Let's go down the stairs!
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

Wh... huh?! Ack, these stairs are so narrow!
##

{Garry} (19)
#Message#

Be careful not to trip and fall, Ib...!
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

That made me jump... Was that a shooting star?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

...Hm? I just had an odd sensation...
Was it my imagination?
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

The stars here have
a particularly unique shape, don't they?
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

As if there would be
a diamond in a place like this...
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

It seems there's no going back...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

It says something there... "Sketchbook"?
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

What's with this dreary room...?
Plus, I'm getting chills...
##

{Garry} (19)
#Message#

Let's quickly find your rose!
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

How can we get back to where we were...?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Not this way, Ib.
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

We managed to get away... Ugh, give me a break!
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

Ah, yes... You'd better recover your rose soon.
Make sure to hold on tight this time, okay?
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

............Gh...
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

......
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

...Phew. Managed to get away...
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

......Let's go.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

I'm glad I had this lighter.
We couldn't have gotten here without it.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Are those roses drawn on the wall?
Yellow roses...
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

Which reminds me of Mary...
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

If my guess is correct,
that painting on the far wall is...
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

Let's... head for the exit.
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

You have the Toy Key, right?
We can enter the yellow building with that.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

There shouldn't be anything left here, Ib.
Let's move on!
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

We can scoop water from the pond over and over,
so feel free to experiment with it.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

A bucket...
I doubt it can do much but hold water.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

I'll continue to entrust you with
deciding how to use the water.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

So we have some water... What to do with it?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Ah well... I'll leave the decision to you.
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

I wonder what this mirror's for?
...Oh dear, I've got awful bags under my eyes...
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

Er, but this isn't the time to be
fussing over my appearance. Sorry...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

A hand mirror...
Another item of uncertain purpose.
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

Hrmm... As hard as I might think about it,
I don't know what use a crayon would have.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

To draw something?
Perhaps the color means something too...?
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

Ib, let's explore the house, shall we?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

If you're at a loss, why don't we first
go to the areas with "?"s on the map?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

That bulletin board... What could that be?
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

The way back is gone...
After coming this far, the only way is forward.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Is this... a flower garden?
Quite the bias toward tulips, though...
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

This pond's big, isn't it?
I'm thirsty, so maybe I'll take a sip...
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

...Or so I thought, but it smells a bit like crayons,
so perhaps I shouldn't...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Why are there horses here?
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

Toy box this, \v[145] that...
It's like we're in a kid's room.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Where could this "toy box" be...?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

That opened the door to that house, didn't it?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

What do you think that sound was?
Should we go take a look?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Don't you suppose this is the yellow building?
The one with a note on it or something...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

This yellow building really stands out.
Let's hope it's a real exit this time...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

A cute little house. Who do you think lives here?
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

Though I suppose if anyone does,
it'd be one of Guertena's works anyway...
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

Splashing water on the black marks
didn't do a thing to get rid of them.
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

Maybe soap and a brush could do the trick...
but no chance of finding those here, I'm sure.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

You know, I'm fine with butterflies, but...
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

Moths kind of gross me out...
Even though they look so similar to butterflies.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Odd how there are buildings here,
and yet not a sign of any people.
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

If the message on the door was telling the truth,
that house should be unlocked now.
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

I think I heard a sound from here...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Read the note on the yellow building...
Shall we look around for that?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Ah, some fruit trees.
Lemons, grapes, cherries, oranges, strawberries...
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

......Strawberries?
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

Mary was looking for us...
Perhaps she feels bitter?
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

...But no, she's one of Guertena's works.
We simply can't stay with her.
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

We just waltzed in here...
Surely we aren't trespassing, right?
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

The puzzle here seems like a tough one...
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

If you're not sure about it... maybe you should
take a walk around the area for a change of pace?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Let's check inside the building, shall we?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

See the door on that big building?
There's an eye on it, right?
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

I believe it's the kind of door that
needs something other than a key to open.
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

I wonder how it might open...
Could we try to pry the eyelid open?
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

How to open this door, if not a key...?
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

If only there were a hint somewhere...
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

A crayon...?!
What are we supposed to use THIS for?
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

Something appeared! What is that?
##

{Garry} (19)
#Message#

It zaps you the moment you make a mistake...!
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

Then there's no guessing at random here...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Say... don't you feel like the pink lines
on the floor are in a familiar pattern?
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

The pictures on the wall, too... we've seen them
in other places. Maybe there's a connection.
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

It feels... almost like I've woken up from a dream...
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

We're... back... in the place with black walls...?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Huh...? This place...
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

Urgh...
I want to get away from this place...!
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

This is just a normal work of art, yes...?
Yet it feels so ominous...
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

It's just my gut feeling, but...
I don't like the looks of this bed.
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

What...? This place...
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

The counter, the stairs...
The promotional fish painting...!
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

Isn't this just like the original gallery?!
Maybe the exit is near...!
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

Whoa, it's dark... Watch your step, Ib.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

I remember this place, too! I was looking at a
painting here when I noticed everyone had vanished...
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

......
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

I wonder if this is the way to the exit...
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

We... can't go back, it seems...
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

What's wrong? Did you forget something?
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

Come, let's head toward the light!
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

H-Hey, this room looks like the one
where I was first attacked...
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

Don't tell me we've looped back there?!
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

...The walls are a different color? A-Ah, true.
Then yes, it must be a different place.
##


**********Common39********** (相談　追加ダンジョン)
{Garry} (04)
#Message#

This painting is an anthill?
An impressive observation, Ib...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

This butterfly has such peculiar wings...
They flicker like flames.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I don't really want to go in there, but...
Shouldn't we check that dark room a bit more?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

This candle painting...
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

It really did become a light, like the title said!
Maybe we can use it in that dark room!
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Doesn't this painting seem... actually bright?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

The color of the walls changed again...
So we've reached a new area.
##

{Garry} (09)
#Message#

It was tough as usual,
but we managed to get through!
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

I suppose this area turns bright or dark
depending on the time on that clock.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Now that it's gotten dark,
I wonder if anything's changed?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Those stones below the clock are an interesting shape.
It's like they have two little ears.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

All right. Now we just need to start up the clock,
and something should happen!
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

So that black thing was the clock's seconds hand...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

To think the butterfly
would go inside that painting...
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

But I guess plenty of things have
popped in and out of paintings already, huh?
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

Why is only the seconds hand removable, anyhow...?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Perhaps that'll make it a bit easier
to go back and forth?
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

It would seem that "white ant" isn't a termite like
in real life, but literally just an ant that's white...
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

How are we meant to "bring a way home"...?
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

There must be a way to make the thorns retract.
Let's proceed in the direction we can go first.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Did something move over there?
It opened a door and went inside...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

So this room wasn't just for these paintings,
but to give the solution to those stones.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

My... These are rather colorful frames.
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

I've had enough scares... My heart can't take it.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Ib, are you okay?
Tell me right away if it hurts!
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

I swear...
If you try anything funny, I'll peel you right off!
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

What is this strange thing...?
It's making a sort of ticking sound.
##

{Garry} (17)
#Message#

Urgh... it's certainly still dark, though...
Burn a little brighter, butterfly...
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

We saved the butterfly here and all,
so how about we check the other rooms?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

So that butterfly from before is coming with us...
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

What is that thing?!
It caught me off guard, coming out so suddenly...!
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Ah, good. It seems that butterfly
was able to fly away just fine.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Ib, won't you help that butterfly that moved?
It might still be able to fly if we act fast...
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

Black roses...
Why would you choose those, I wonder?
##

{Garry} (19)
#Message#

Are you all right?!
We have to nimbly evade those darts!
##

{Garry} (06)
#Message#

There are darts of some kind coming at us...
Be careful not to get hit by one, Ib.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

You feel sorry for the insects?
True... but remember, they're artificial.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

...? Do you hear something?
##

{Garry} (13)
#Message#

Now, let's keep up the pace!
##

{Garry} (19)
#Message#

These stairs are killer... There's still more?
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

Ahh, that was brutal...
Such cruelty on my exhausted legs...
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

Such long stairs...!
How many steps do you suppose there are?
##

{Garry} (07)
#Message#

Ib, let's go in that painting...
There seems to be no other way to go.
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

It's like someone's smeared it with paint...
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

Wh-What the...! What's going on here?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Huh... Does the floor look dirty to you?
Around the entrance to the hall...
##

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

There are six doors in total...
Which might mean six rooms.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Perhaps there's one of those tiles in each room?
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

This room is huge...!
And such large sculptures...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Ib, are you okay? Not too tired, are you?
##

{Garry} (09)
#Message#

After how far we've come, we'll absolutely get home!
##

{Garry} (13)
#Message#

It would be annoying if they came back out,
so I tied the croquis book up tight.
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

Urgh... My hands are stained black
after catching all of those things.
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Is that all of them?
Now let's put them into the croquis book!
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

The room feels so quiet now...!
##

{Garry} (07)
#Message#

Those red ones are ferocious...
They'll pluck your rose, so be careful!
##

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

There may be lots of these things,
but they aren't that fast!
##

{Garry} (04)
#Message#

This room's full of scribbles.
I'm being reminded of the toy box...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

This room smells intensely of graphite...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Okay! We're all good here.
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

That gave me a fright...
The whole painting falling is foul play!
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

So only that painting was moving?
You're very attentive...
##

{Garry} (10)
#Message#

Cycloptic Smile... Besides the sheer number of them,
the art itself is pretty eerie...
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

Waugh, what's this room?
So many of the same painting...!
##

{Garry} (13)
#Message#

Now, let's keep it up!
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

That strange thing vanished...
Thank goodness...
##

{Garry} (07)
#Message#

...!
I suppose this thing's an enemy too...!
##

{Garry} (03)
#Message#

Whoa! Hey, Ib!
Something strange came out!
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

What's this? A cactus maze...
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

So this painting wouldn't appear
unless that bird returned home...
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

I'm glad this one wasn't anything too complicated.
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Isn't that bird the one
from the croquis room earlier?
##

{Garry} (20)
#Message#

Oh? A straight path... Is this all there is?
##

{Garry} (05)
#Message#

We've solved many puzzles at this point,
but this feels like it was the hardest...
##

{Garry} (18)
#Message#

It's not going to bite our hands
when we try to take that tile, is it...?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

It seems we can talk to that box.
Let's ask if we can get a hint!
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Ib, do you think you can solve this...?
##

#Choice#
Maybe...
......
##

<たぶん……>

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

W-Well, why don't you report your results?
Who knows, you might've gotten it right!
##

<………………>

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Hmm... Should we try asking that box
if it can give us some kind of hint?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

How's it going, Ib?
##

#Choice#
I think I've got it!
I'm still not sure
##

<できたかも！>

{Garry} (02)
#Message#

Really?!
Then let's tell the talking box!
##

<まだわかんない>

{Garry} (14)
#Message#

I was just thinking about the
"pistol aims at the three eyes up close" thing...
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

The pistol points left, so the three-eyes painting
has to be immediately to the left of it, right?
##

{Garry} (01)
#Message#

Once those two paintings are locked in,
that confirms the positions of the others.
##

{Garry} (00)
#Message#

Hmm... Figured it out, Ib?
##

#Choice#
I'll give it a try
I don't know...
##

<ちょっとやってみる>
